Solutions to Advent of Code

## 2020
First year I solved all problems, first year I upload my solutions.
All solved on my mediocre phone using [Termux](https://termux.com), [ViM](https://www.vim.org/) and of course the [J902 on Android](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Installation/J902).
The solutions expect inputs in files named as "2020-x.txt" where x is the day number.
The days variable contains all day numbers (1-25) to be executed when 2020.ijs is loaded.

## 2023
Solutions until Day 21, part 1.
Now uses my [JAoC](https://github.com/jpjacobs/general_jaoc) addon that automatically downloads and caches input etc.
Each day's solution is a verb defined by `dayno day {{...}}` in which the body defines p1 and p2 verbs for part 1 and part 2.
